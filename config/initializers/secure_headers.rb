# A CSP is delivered via a HTTP response header, much like HSTS, and defines
# approved sources of content that the browser may load. It can be an
# effective countermeasure to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and is
# also widely supported and usually easily deployed.

  # Specifically here we are saying
  # - scripts can only come from the service or Google, however we permit
  #   unsafe-inlinescripts (Google to support analytics)
  # - images can only come from the service and Google (GA because it sends
  #   the data to the Analytics server via a list of parameters attached to
  #   a single-pixel image request)
  # - fonts can only come from the service, or via the data: scheme
  # - send any violation reports to a service we have setup for CSP
  # - for all other items their soiurce must be the service (default-src)
