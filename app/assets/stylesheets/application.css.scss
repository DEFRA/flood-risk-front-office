// The govuk_elements_rails gem (https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements_rails)
// allows us to pull in govuk_elements, a collection of sass and js building blocks.
// Using this gem makes it easier for us to update to the latest version of govuk_elements.
//
// Note that govuk_elements_rails will bring in the govuk_frontend_toolkit
// (as a dependency) but not govuk_template, which we need to specify in the Gemfile.
// There is a fair bit to understand about how the 3 projects are related and loaded.
// Pulling in govuk-elements.scss here will pull in all sass at:
// https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/blob/master/public/sass/_govuk-elements.scss
